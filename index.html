                    My name is Milton Harper, and my background is in Nursing, originally when i first started college I
                    wanted to be a simulation and game developer but i strayed away from it for awhile and focused on
                    nursing. Rediscovery a form of computer science I was intrigued with all of the things you can do if
                    you became a Full Stack Developer. I took interest in coding recently with the problem solving
                    aspects , and see all the blueprint finally function as a complete whole.



                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    I spend most of my time learning about different art forms, spending time outdoors enjoying nature,
                    and anime and gaming.
                    I'm originally from New Jersey , but relocated to NC at a young age. I would like to travel to
                    Japan, Bali, and Ethiopia in the future. Goals I would like to achieve are becoming a Full Stack
                    Developer, Finishing my Nursing degree and desgining my own anime and/or video game starting a new
                    corporation.
                    most outside of the U.S. to eleven countries and hope to continue to do so in the near future.
